# Add Comments in VSCode

First off, I have no idea what I'm doing, this is my first VSCode extension. GPT4 made this and I'm pretty sure I compiled it with a lot of unnecessary node modules. If anyone wants to change it, I'll update it here.

# How to Install

CTRL+SHIFT+P -> Install Extension from Location -> Select Folder that it's contained in.

# How to Use

When you are inside an editor, right click and press "Add comment" in the context menu. Enter a label for the comment and press Enter.
